DESCRIPTION

This project's main idea was to use the basic Data Transformation and Visualization tools available in Power Bi to perform the following Tasks:
1. Data cleaning
2. Segment the visuals using country, region & market
3. Analyzation of the data by visualizing the percentage of shipping based on ship mode.

In this Project I have created an interactive sales report to show the stakeholders.
